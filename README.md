### Weekly Schedule Overview
- **Days**: Let’s say Monday, Wednesday, Friday (adjust as needed).
- **Time**: 2 hours each day (10:00 AM–12:00 PM, for example).
- **Structure**: Each session splits into 30-minute blocks—mixing active, hands-on learning with seated, focused tasks to stretch their attention spans gradually while keeping it fun.
- **Faith’s Role**: 
  - **Monday**: Full engagement—Faith leads activities.
  - **Wednesday & Friday**: Boys work semi-independently with check-ins from Faith as she’s nearby.

### Curriculum Goals
**Theo (1st Grade)**:
- **Math**: Master numbers 0-20, deepen place value understanding (tens and ones), and build confidence with addition/subtraction.
- **Reading**: Expand sight words, practice decoding longer words, and increase story length (aim for 5-10 minute reads).
- **Science/Exploration**: Leverage his interest in engines and maps with simple projects.

**Liam (Pre-K)**:
- **Basics**: Solidify numbers 0-10, colors, shapes, and introduce letters (focus on recognition and sounds).
- **Language**: Boost vocabulary and clarity through songs, stories, and play.

### Daily Breakdown
#### Monday (Faith-Led Day) – 2 Hours
**10:00–10:30 – Math Fun (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Place Value Game—Use small objects (e.g., beans or LEGO bricks) to build “tens” and “ones” (e.g., 14 = 1 ten-stick + 4 ones). Faith explains a number; Theo builds it.  
- **Liam**: Number Hunt—Faith hides cards (0-10) around the room. Liam finds them, names the number, and matches it to objects (e.g., 3 = 3 rocks).  
- *Patience Practice*: Both sit for the last 5 minutes to tally their “scores” together.

**10:30–11:00 – Story Time (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Faith reads a 5-7 minute story (e.g., *Magic Tree House* or a simple science book about engines). Theo retells 1-2 events after.  
- **Liam**: Joins for the story, then names 1 color or shape he spots in the pictures.  
- *Patience Practice*: Sitting for the full story builds focus.

**11:00–11:30 – Hands-On Science (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Build a simple “engine” with cardboard tubes, tape, and a toy car—talk about “push/pull” motion.  
- **Liam**: Helps tape or fetch items, names shapes in the build (circle wheels, rectangle body).  
- *Active Fun*: Keeps their energy flowing.

**11:30–12:00 – Wrap-Up (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Writes or draws 1 thing he learned (e.g., “The car moved!”).  
- **Liam**: Sings a color song with Faith (e.g., “Red, yellow, green, and blue…”).

#### Wednesday (Semi-Independent) – 2 Hours
**10:00–10:30 – Tablet Time (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: App like *Khan Academy Kids*—place value or addition games (20 min), then sits to draw a number (e.g., 12 as 1 ten + 2 ones).  
- **Liam**: App like *Endless Alphabet*—letter sounds or shapes (20 min), then points to a color in the room.  
- *Faith’s Role*: Sets up tablets, checks in once.

**10:30–11:00 – Reading (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Reads a short book (e.g., *Bob Books*) aloud to Liam for 10 min, then sits to write 1 sentence about it.  
- **Liam**: Listens, points to 1 picture he likes, and says a word about it.  
- *Patience Practice*: Theo reads, Liam sits quietly.

**11:00–11:30 – Outdoor Math (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Counts steps to a tree (e.g., 15), breaks it into tens and ones (1 ten + 5 ones).  
- **Liam**: Collects 5 sticks, names their shapes (long, short, curved).  
- *Active Fun*: Gets them moving.

**11:30–12:00 – Free Play with Purpose**  
- Faith gives a “mission” (e.g., “Find something red” for Liam, “Count 10 rocks” for Theo). Boys report back.

#### Friday (Semi-Independent) – 2 Hours
**10:00–10:30 – Art & Letters (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Draws a map of your yard, labels 2-3 spots (e.g., “tree,” “house”).  
- **Liam**: Colors a shape sheet (circle, square), names them aloud.  
- *Faith’s Role*: Hands out paper/crayons, checks in.

**10:30–11:00 – Math Play (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo**: Uses objects (sticks, coins) to solve 3 addition problems (e.g., 7 + 4).  
- **Liam**: Counts objects up to 10 with Theo’s help.  
- *Patience Practice*: Sitting to count together.

**11:00–11:30 – Music & Movement (Both Boys)**  
- **Theo & Liam**: Sing a counting song (e.g., “10 Little Monkeys”) and act it out—jump for each number.  
- *Active Fun*: Burns energy, reinforces numbers.

**11:30–12:00 – Story Creation**  
- **Theo**: Tells Liam a 5-min story (e.g., about a car adventure), draws 1 scene.  
- **Liam**: Adds 1 idea (e.g., “It’s blue!”).

- **Optional Additions**: 
  - *Bob Books* or similar for Theo ($10-15 set).
  - Number cards (0-20) or printables (free online).
  - Simple science book (library or $5 used).

### Notes for Success
- **Patience Building**: Start with 20-minute seated tasks, nudging up to 30 as they adjust. Keep it light—praise effort over perfection.
- **Flexibility**: If a day’s off, swap activities or let them play—their gardening and cooking with Faith are learning too!
- **Progress Check**: Every month, ask Theo to explain place value or read a page, and Liam to name 5 colors or count to 10. Adjust as they grow.
